# Summary

## Binary
range of bit: (256)
Max:  2^8 - 1
Min: 0


### signed binary numbers (For negative numbers)
The first digit is signed bit and it is here below:
1 - negative
0 - positive


## Signed Integers: int
```
Max : 2^(8-1)-1
Min: - 2^(8-1)
```
### Know the difference between signed integers and unsigned integer

uint is always positive
Int can either be positive or negative

### byte
A byte is 8 bits.
It can be used to store a number or character
type = int8
use single quotation

### bits
The number of values that can be represented. e.g int8

## Rune
type= int32

## bool
true or false


## string
use double quotation

## Implicit Vs Explicit

### 
```
Println - standard output
Printf()- Formatted
```

### %T
```
%T - Data type
%v - value
%b - binary
%e - scientific representation
%f - float representation (e.g fmt.Printf(".2f"), 10.2f)
%s- string
%% - To add %
\" - for quotation 
```


## Sprintf
creates a string but not print it out


## Arithmetic operator
